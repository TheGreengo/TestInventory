# TestInventory
Web app to use for learning Django/React

# Sketch
Here's what I'm thinking

## UI
- there is a item list page which shows all of the items (broken up to pages of course)
    - filters are available for department, delinquent, available, etc.
- personell page where you can click on individual 
- individual personell page
    - items checked out
    - items overdue

## DB
There should be tables for:
- items
    - checked out
    - who last checked out
    - long term home
    - ownership department
    - id number
    - date last checked out
    - overdue
    - date of expected return
    - id of person who checked it out
- personell
    - id number
    - department
- users
